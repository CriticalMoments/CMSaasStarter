<p>
  We've written a detailed blog post about how we took this template, and
  created a real <a href="https://criticalmoments.io" target="_blank"
    >SaaS company website</a
  >. Topics include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Optimizing the stack for performance and developer productivity</li>
  <li>Creating rich interactive animations with Svelte</li>
  <li>Creating pixel perfect designs without rasterization</li>
  <li>Speed measurements: how we kept it small and lightning fast</li>
</ul>
