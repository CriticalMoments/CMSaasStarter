<p class="lead">What this project is and why I am making it.</p>

<p>
  Well, I am a computer science student from Belfast, currently studying at the University of Liverpool. 
  I have always been interested in stocks and trading and always wondered why I can't see certain stats 
  about my portfolio specifically; projected dividend income and projected compound growth ... 
  hence the name "Snowball Stats."

<p> Goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I want it to be affordable, as cheap as I can make it (stock data is expensive)</li>
  <li>Be able to import portfolio from broker e.g. Trading 212 and it syncs to when you buy/sell</li>
  <li>Be useful, provide actual insight into long-term growth</li>
  <li>Be helpful, help users meet their financial goals, and illustrate the powerful effects of the "snowball"</li>
</ul>
