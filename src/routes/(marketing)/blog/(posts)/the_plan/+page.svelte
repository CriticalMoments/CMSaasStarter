<p class="lead">What this project is and why I am making it.</p>

<p>
  Well I am a computer sciece student from Belfast, currently studying at the University of Liverpool.
  I have always been intrested in stocks and tradeing and always wondered why I cant see certain stats about my portfolio
  specifcially; projected dividned income and projected compound growth ... hence the name "Snowball Stats."
</p>

<p> Goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I want it to be aforadable, as cheap as I can make it (stock data is expensive)</li>
  <li>Be able to import portfolio from broker e.g. Trading 212 and it sync to when you buy/sell</li>
  <li>Be usefull, provide acctual insight into long term growth</li>
  <li>Be helpful, help users meet there fincacial goals and illistae the powerful effects of the "snowball"</li>
</ul>
