<h2 class="lead">Exploration, dead ends, u-turns.</h2>

<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Day 1 began with the objective of finding and using a Framer saas template as an alternative to closed source boilerplate code like ShipFast from Marc Lou.  I have some experience using Figma for mobile mocking and design, so adapted quickly to Framer, which lets you jump from design straight to hosting without touching code.  GPT implied that code could be exported and used independently, which is not actually the case.  The idea was to customize existing saas templates then export them for reuse as my own boilerplate.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As it turns out, it's for the better this didn't work, as the OpenSource code I found from https://saasstarter.work solves a lot of problems I haven't touched yet like user auth etc, while allowing me to add pages and features I've already prototyped from scratch like the original goodpair graphs.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a lot of issues in the beginning as I went straight to feeding GPT code and file structures instead of being more patient and reading the readme line by line.  In addition to commiting the readme to gpt memory (features still kindof sucks and it's unclear what it actually remembers), I stepped through slowly, which fixed extremely simple issues that wasted a ton of time in the morning.  For example, gpt had me storing supabase api keys in .env, whereas the readme indicates that .env.local should be used.  After scrapping everything and reading the directions, things are going smoothly.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm writing this post because using the blog is detailed in the README.  It's the gift that keeps on giving.  It's named that for a reason.
