## Performance / Best Practices

The selected tech stack creates lightning fast websites.

 - Pre-rendering (static generation) for marketing pages, pricing and blog
 - Instant navigation: the best of CSR + SSR in one. SSR your first page for fastest possible initial load times. For subsequent pages, the content is pre-loaded and rendered with CSR, for instant rendering.
 - CDN optimized, for high edge-cache hit ratios
 - Edge-functions for dynamic APIs/pages
 - Svelte and Tailwind compile out unused HTML, CSS and JS at deploy time for smaller pages
 - Linting to find accessibility and syntax issues
